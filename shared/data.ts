Minimalist bedroom design isn\'t about deprivation; it\'s about intentionality.</p><h3>Key Elements of a Minimalist Bedroom</h3><p>Start with a neutral color palette. Soft whites, warm beiges, and gentle grays create a calming atmosphere that promotes relaxation. Natural materials like linen, cotton, and wood add warmth without visual clutter.</p><h3>The Power of Negative Space</h3><p>Empty space is not wasted space—it\'s breathing room for your mind.
